"""Smoke tests for the minimal-PATH sandbox image (docker/Dockerfile.sandbox).

These tests validate that the constants defined in ``hypervisor.sandbox``
are internally consistent and that a simulated minimal sandbox PATH
exposes only the intentionally allowed binaries.

The simulation works by creating a temporary directory, populating it
with stub executables for each entry in ``ALLOWED_BINARIES``, and then
calling ``shutil.which`` with that directory as the sole PATH.  This
approach is portable (no Docker daemon required) and deterministic
(independent of the host filesystem).

To run a full end-to-end smoke test against the built container image,
use the ``python3`` exec form.  The image ships no shell (``/bin/sh``
and ``/usr/bin/sh`` are removed during the build), so a ``sh -c`` wrapper
would fail with "executable file not found"::

    docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.sandbox -t hypervisor-sandbox .
    docker run --rm hypervisor-sandbox python3 -c "import shutil; assert all(shutil.which(c) is None for c in ['curl', 'wget', 'nc', 'bash', 'perl', 'ruby', 'gcc']); print('All denied binaries absent: OK')"

Wired into the Ring-3 sandbox provider tests via the shared
``hypervisor.sandbox`` module imported in ``test_ring_enforcement.py``.
