# Language Package Matrix

> **Last updated:** April 2026

The Agent Governance Toolkit ships language packages in **5 languages**. Python is the primary
implementation; the other language packages now cover most core governance primitives needed to
build governed agents in each ecosystem.

## Quick Comparison

**Legend:** ✅ Implemented · ◑ Partial · — Not yet available

> **Note:** .NET remains partial for cross-language identity parity because it now supports
> stronger native asymmetric identity flows, while the other SDKs still center on Ed25519-based

## Detailed Breakdown

### Core Governance (all 5 language packages)

Every language package implements the four foundational governance primitives. These are sufficient
to build governed agents in any language:

| Primitive | What It Does | Python | TS | .NET | Rust | Go |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Policy evaluation | Evaluate actions against rules before execution | `PolicyEvaluator` | `PolicyEngine` | `PolicyEngine` | `PolicyEngine` | `PolicyEngine` |
| Agent identity | Cryptographic credentials | `AgentIdentity` | `AgentIdentity` | `AgentIdentity` (.NET 8 compatibility signing, delegation, JWK/JWKS, DID docs) | `Identity` | `AgentIdentity` |
| Trust scoring | 0–1000 score based on behavior | `TrustEngine` | `TrustEngine` | `TrustStore` | `TrustEngine` | `TrustManager` |
| Audit logging | Append-only action log | `AuditLogger` | `AuditLogger` | `AuditLogger` | `AuditLogger` | `AuditLogger` |

### Python-Only Capabilities

These capabilities are only available in Python today. They represent the full
governance stack for enterprise deployments:

| Capability | Package | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Replay Debugging** | `agent-sre` | Deterministic replay of agent sessions |
| **Governance Dashboard** | `demo/` | Real-time fleet visibility (Streamlit) |
| **Unified CLI (`agt`)** | `agent-compliance` | `agt verify`, `agt doctor`, `agt lint-policy` |
| **OWASP Verification** | `agent-compliance` | ASI 2026 compliance attestation |
| **20+ Framework Adapters** | `agentmesh-integrations` | LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents, Google ADK, etc. |

### TypeScript package

**Package:** [`@microsoft/agent-governance-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/agent-governance-sdk) ·
**Source:** [`agent-governance-typescript/`](../agent-governance-typescript/)

| Module | Features |
|--------|----------|
| `PolicyEngine` | Rule evaluation, allow/deny decisions, effect-based policies |
| `AgentIdentity` | Ed25519 key generation, DID creation, credential signing/verification |
| `TrustEngine` | Trust score tracking, tier classification, decay |
| `AuditLogger` | Structured audit events, JSON export |
| `McpSecurityScanner` | Tool poisoning, typosquatting, hidden instruction, rug pull detection |
| `LifecycleManager` | 8-state lifecycle with validated transitions and event logging |
| `RingEnforcer` / `KillSwitch` | Deny-by-default execution rings, breach handling, and emergency termination hooks |
| `PromptDefenseEvaluator` / `GovernanceVerifier` / `ShadowDiscovery` | Prompt auditing, control attestation, runtime evidence verification, and local discovery scanning |
| `GovernanceMetrics` / `SLOTracker` / `CircuitBreaker` | Metrics, error-budget tracking, and resilience primitives |
| `GenericFrameworkAdapter` | Generic governance adapter for framework integrations |
| `AgentMeshClient` | High-level client combining all primitives |

**Roadmap:** Framework-specific adapters beyond the generic integration surface.

### .NET package

**Package:** [`Microsoft.AgentGovernance`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AgentGovernance) ·
**Source:** [`agent-governance-dotnet/`](../agent-governance-dotnet/)

| Namespace | Features |
|-----------|----------|
| `Policy` | `PolicyEngine` with YAML/JSON policy loading, organization scope, richer decision metadata, and fail-closed OPA/Rego and Cedar backends |
| `Trust` | `AgentIdentity`, `IdentityRegistry`, `FileTrustStore`, delegation helpers, JWK/JWKS, DID document export, and native asymmetric ECDSA P-256 support |
| `Audit` | `AuditLogger`, `AuditEmitter` with structured events |
| `Hypervisor` | `ExecutionRings` (4-tier), `SagaOrchestrator`, `KillSwitch` |
| `Lifecycle` | `LifecycleManager` with 8-state machine and validated transitions |
| `Sre` | `SloEngine` with objectives and error budget tracking |
| `Security` | Prompt injection detection and `PromptDefenseEvaluator` |
| `Discovery` | Config scanning, process scanning, reconciliation, inventory, and risk scoring |
| `Integration` | `GovernanceMiddleware` for ASP.NET / Agent Framework |
| `RateLimiting` | Token bucket rate limiter |
| `Telemetry` | OpenTelemetry integration |
| `Mcp` | `McpSecurityScanner` (poisoning, typosquatting, hidden instructions, rug pull, schema abuse, cross-server), `McpResponseSanitizer`, `McpCredentialRedactor`, `McpGateway` |

**Roadmap:** Native asymmetric Ed25519 signing once the target runtime supports it broadly, plus full lifecycle persistence.

### Rust crate

**Crate:** [`agentmesh`](https://crates.io/crates/agentmesh) +
[`agentmesh-mcp`](https://crates.io/crates/agentmesh-mcp) ·
**Source:** [`agent-governance-rust/`](../agent-governance-rust/)

| Module | Features |
|--------|----------|
| `policy` | Rule-based policy evaluation with allow/deny effects plus OPA/Rego and Cedar helper support |
| `identity` | Ed25519 key generation, DID creation, credential signing, delegation, and JWK/JWKS helpers |
| `trust` | Trust scoring, tier classification, behavioral tracking, and trust-handshake helpers |
| `audit` | Append-only audit log with structured events |
| `mcp` | MCP tool definition scanning, poisoning detection, and the standalone `agentmesh-mcp` security surface |
| `rings` | 4-tier execution privilege rings with configurable permissions, kill switch, circuit breaker, and SLO helpers |
| `lifecycle` | 8-state lifecycle manager with validated transitions |
| `integration_support` | Framework adapters, governance middleware, discovery, and prompt defense helpers |

The standalone `agentmesh-mcp` crate provides MCP-specific security primitives
(gateway, rate limiting, redaction, session management) without pulling in the
full governance stack.

**Roadmap:** Additional async-runtime polish and deeper framework-specific integrations.
