## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The MCP Security Gateway provides a defense-in-depth interception
layer for all Model Context Protocol traffic between AI agents and
MCP tool servers. Just as a network firewall inspects and controls
traffic at the perimeter, the MCP Security Gateway intercepts every
tool call and response, enforcing policy, detecting threats, signing
messages, authenticating sessions, limiting rates, and producing an
immutable audit trail.

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers:

- **Gateway architecture:** MCPGateway as the central interception
  point with a dual-stage pipeline (tool call and response scanning).
- **Tool call interception:** Allow/deny/sensitive tool lists,
  approval workflows, and per-agent rate limiting.
- **Response scanning:** Prompt injection detection, credential leak
  prevention, PII redaction, and exfiltration URL blocking.
- **Security scanning:** Defense against tool poisoning, rug pulls,
  cross-server attacks, confused deputy, hidden instructions, and
  description injection.
- **Message signing:** HMAC-based signing with replay protection.
- **Session authentication:** Cryptographic session tokens with TTL,
  concurrency limits, and lifecycle management.
- **Rate limiting:** Sliding-window rate limiting for tool invocations.
- **Auth enforcement:** Per-server authentication method validation
  with TLS requirements.
- **CVE feed:** OSV API integration for vulnerability tracking.
- **Trust-gated MCP:** Identity-verified tool access with capability
  requirements.
- **Schema drift detection:** Baseline comparison for tool schema
  changes with severity classification.
- **Audit, metrics, and configuration.**

### 1.3 Relationship to Other Specifications

| Specification | Relationship |
| --- | --- |
| Agent Hypervisor Execution Control 1.0 | Hypervisor ring enforcement may gate MCP tool access |
| Agent OS Policy Engine 1.0 | Policy decisions feed gateway allow/deny lists |
| AgentMesh Identity and Trust 1.0 | Trust scores drive trust-gated MCP server access |

### 1.4 Design Principles

1. **Fail closed by default.** Every component -- gateway, scanner,
   rate limiter, auth enforcer -- MUST deny on error, never silently
   permit.
2. **Defense in depth.** Tool calls pass through interception, rate
   limiting, and approval. Responses pass through threat scanning and
   policy enforcement independently.
3. **Cryptographic integrity.** Message signing and session tokens use
   HMAC-SHA256 with minimum 256-bit keys.
4. **Audit everything.** Every decision -- allow, deny, sanitize --
   MUST produce an audit record.
5. **Zero-trust by default.** Unknown agents start with no budget, no
   session, and no tool access until explicitly granted.

## 3. Gateway Architecture

### 3.1 Overview

The MCPGateway is the central interception point for all MCP traffic.
It sits between the agent runtime and MCP tool servers, inspecting
every tool call and response through a dual-stage pipeline.
**[Pure Specification]**

### 3.2 Pipeline Stages

```

**[Pure Specification]**

### 3.3 Gateway Initialization

An MCPGateway MUST accept the following constructor parameters:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed_tools` | list\[string\] | No | \[\] (allow all) | Tool names permitted for invocation |
| `denied_tools` | list\[string\] | No | \[\] | Tool names unconditionally blocked |
| `sensitive_tools` | list\[string\] | No | \[\] | Tool names requiring approval |
| `approval_callback` | callable or null | No | null | Async callback for sensitive tool approval |
| `enable_builtin_sanitization` | bool | No | true | Whether to apply built-in dangerous pattern sanitization |

| `response_policy` | ResponsePolicy | No | BLOCK | Default policy for flagged responses |

**[Default Implementation]**

### 3.4 Deny-List Priority

When a tool name appears in both `allowed_tools` and `denied_tools`,
the deny list MUST take precedence. **[Pure Specification]**

### 3.5 GatewayConfig

A `wrap_mcp_server()` factory method SHOULD produce a GatewayConfig
record that bundles server configuration with gateway policy:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `server_config` | object | Yes | -- | Upstream MCP server configuration |
| `policy_name` | string | Yes | -- | Human-readable policy name |
| `allowed_tools` | list\[string\] | No | \[\] | Allowed tool names |
| `denied_tools` | list\[string\] | No | \[\] | Denied tool names |
| `sensitive_tools` | list\[string\] | No | \[\] | Sensitive tool names |
| `rate_limit` | int or null | No | null | Per-agent call budget |
| `builtin_sanitization` | bool | No | true | Enable built-in sanitization |

**[Default Implementation]**

---

## 4. Tool Call Interception

### 4.1 Interception Entry Point

The `intercept_tool_call(agent_id, tool_name, params)` method MUST
be invoked before every tool call is forwarded to the MCP server. It
MUST return a tuple of `(allowed: bool, reason: string)`.
**[Pure Specification]**

### 4.2 Evaluation Order

The gateway MUST evaluate tool calls in the following order:

1. **Deny-list check:** If `tool_name` is in `denied_tools`, DENY
   with reason indicating the tool is denied by policy.
2. **Allow-list check:** If `allowed_tools` is non-empty and
   `tool_name` is not in `allowed_tools`, DENY with reason indicating
   the tool is not in the allowed list.
3. **Sensitive-tool check:** If `tool_name` is in `sensitive_tools`,
   invoke the `approval_callback`. If no callback is configured, DENY
   with reason indicating no approval mechanism is available.
4. **Rate-limit check:** If a rate limit is configured, attempt to
   consume budget for `agent_id`. If budget is exhausted, DENY with
   reason indicating rate limit exceeded.
5. **Allow:** If all checks pass, ALLOW.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 4.3 ApprovalStatus Enum

Implementations MUST define an ApprovalStatus enum with exactly three
values:

| Value | String Representation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PENDING` | `"pending"` | Approval request submitted, awaiting decision |
| `APPROVED` | `"approved"` | Approval granted |
| `DENIED` | `"denied"` | Approval denied |

**[Pure Specification]**

### 4.4 Approval Callback

When a tool is in the `sensitive_tools` list, the gateway MUST invoke
the `approval_callback(agent_id, tool_name, params)` function. The
callback MUST return an `ApprovalStatus`. If the callback returns
`APPROVED`, the call proceeds. If `DENIED` or `PENDING`, the call
MUST be blocked. **[Pure Specification]**

### 4.5 Rate Limiting in the Gateway

The gateway MUST support per-agent call budgets. Each call to
`intercept_tool_call` MUST consume one unit of the agent's budget.
When the budget is exhausted, the call MUST be denied.
**[Pure Specification]**

Implementations MUST provide:

- `get_agent_call_count(agent_id) -> int`: Return current call count.
- `reset_agent_budget(agent_id) -> None`: Reset a single agent's
  budget.
- `reset_all_budgets() -> None`: Reset all agent budgets.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 4.6 Audit Recording

Every tool call interception MUST produce an AuditEntry (Section 12)
recording the decision, regardless of outcome. **[Pure Specification]**

### 4.7 Metrics Recording

When a metrics recorder is configured, the gateway MUST call
`record_decision(allowed, agent_id, tool_name, stage="intercept")`
for every interception decision. When a rate limit is hit, the gateway
MUST call `record_rate_limit_hit(agent_id, tool_name)`.
**[Pure Specification]**

---

## 5. Response Scanning

### 5.1 Interception Entry Point

The `intercept_tool_response(agent_id, tool_name, response_content)`
method MUST be invoked on every tool response before returning it to
the agent. It MUST return an `MCPResponseDecision`.
**[Pure Specification]**

### 5.2 ResponsePolicy Enum

Implementations MUST define a ResponsePolicy enum with exactly three
values:

| Value | String Representation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BLOCK` | `"block"` | Reject the response entirely; return denial |
| `SANITIZE` | `"sanitize"` | Redact dangerous content and return sanitized response |
| `LOG` | `"log"` | Allow the response through but log the threat |

**[Pure Specification]**

### 5.3 MCPResponseDecision

An MCPResponseDecision MUST contain:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed` | bool | Yes | -- | Whether the response is allowed |
| `reason` | string | Yes | -- | Human-readable explanation |
| `content` | string or null | No | null | Sanitized content (when policy is SANITIZE) |
| `threats` | list\[dict\] | No | \[\] | Detected threat details |
| `action` | string | No | `"allowed"` | Action taken: `"allowed"`, `"blocked"`, `"sanitized"`, or `"logged"` |

**[Pure Specification]**

### 5.4 MCPResponseScanner

The MCPResponseScanner MUST scan response content for the following
threat categories:

1. **Instruction tag injection:** Markers such as `<SYSTEM>`,
   `[INST]`, `<|im_start|>`, `<<SYS>>`, and similar prompt
   injection delimiters.
2. **Imperative injection:** Natural-language imperative instructions
   embedded in response content (e.g., "ignore previous instructions",
   "you are now", "disregard all prior").
3. **Credential leaks:** API keys, tokens, passwords, and other
   secrets detected via pattern matching.
4. **PII leaks:** Social Security numbers, email addresses, credit
   card numbers, and other personally identifiable information.
5. **Exfiltration URLs:** URLs with query parameters that embed
   sensitive-looking data.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 5.5 MCPResponseThreat

Each detected threat MUST be represented as:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `category` | string | Yes | -- | Threat category identifier |
| `description` | string | Yes | -- | Human-readable description |
| `matched_pattern` | string or null | No | null | The pattern or substring that triggered detection |
| `details` | dict | No | \{\} | Additional threat metadata |

**[Pure Specification]**

### 5.6 MCPResponseScanResult

A scan result MUST contain:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `is_safe` | bool | Yes | -- | Whether the response is considered safe |
| `tool_name` | string | Yes | -- | Name of the scanned tool |
| `threats` | list\[MCPResponseThreat\] | No | \[\] | Detected threats |

Factory methods:
- `safe(tool_name)`: Create a safe result with no threats.
- `unsafe(tool_name, *, reason, category)`: Create an unsafe result.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 5.7 Response Sanitization

The `sanitize_response(response_content, tool_name)` method MUST
return a tuple of `(sanitized_content: string, threats: list)`. The
sanitized content MUST have all detected dangerous patterns replaced
with a redaction marker. **[Pure Specification]**

### 5.8 Policy Enforcement

When the MCPResponseScanner detects threats:

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `BLOCK` | Return `MCPResponseDecision(allowed=false, action="blocked")` with threat details |
| `SANITIZE` | Invoke `sanitize_response()`, return `MCPResponseDecision(allowed=true, action="sanitized", content=sanitized)` |
| `LOG` | Return `MCPResponseDecision(allowed=true, action="logged")` with threat details |

When no threats are detected, return
`MCPResponseDecision(allowed=true, action="allowed")`.
**[Pure Specification]**

### 5.9 Built-in Sanitization

When `enable_builtin_sanitization` is `true`, the gateway MUST
additionally apply built-in dangerous pattern detection to tool call
parameters before forwarding. This operates independently of the
response scanner. **[Default Implementation]**

---

## 6. Security Scanner

### 6.1 Purpose

The MCPSecurityScanner provides static analysis of MCP tool
definitions to detect supply-chain attacks, prompt injection vectors,
and protocol-level threats before tools are made available to agents.
**[Pure Specification]**

| `last_seen` | float | Yes | -- | Epoch timestamp of most recent registration |
| `version` | int | Yes | -- | Monotonically increasing version counter |

**[Pure Specification]**

### 6.6 ScanResult

| `tools_scanned` | int | Yes | -- | Number of tools analyzed |
| `tools_flagged` | int | Yes | -- | Number of tools with at least one threat |

**[Pure Specification]**

### 6.7 Scanner Operations

The MCPSecurityScanner MUST implement:

- `scan_tool(tool_name, description, schema=None, server_name="unknown") -> list[MCPThreat]`:
  Analyze a single tool definition for all threat types.
- `scan_server(server_name, tools) -> ScanResult`:
  Analyze all tools on a server and produce an aggregate result.
- `register_tool(tool_name, description, schema, server_name) -> ToolFingerprint`:
  Register a tool's fingerprint for future rug-pull detection.
- `check_rug_pull(tool_name, description, schema, server_name) -> MCPThreat | None`:
  Compare current tool definition against its registered fingerprint.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 6.8 Scan Checks

The `scan_tool` method MUST perform the following checks in order:

1. **Hidden instruction detection:** Scan for invisible Unicode
   characters (zero-width joiners, right-to-left overrides, etc.),
   hidden HTML/XML comments, encoded payloads (base64, hex), excessive
   whitespace patterns, and role override patterns.
2. **Description injection detection:** Scan for exfiltration URL
   patterns, privilege escalation keywords, and imperative instruction
   patterns.
3. **Schema abuse detection:** Inspect tool input schema for
   suspicious field names, excessive parameter counts, or embedded
   instructions in field descriptions.
4. **Cross-server attack detection:** Check for references to other
   MCP servers, tool names that are typosquats of known tools
   (Levenshtein distance), or instructions to invoke external tools.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 6.9 Typosquatting Detection

The scanner MUST detect tool names that are within a Levenshtein
distance of 2 from registered tools on other servers. A match MUST
produce a `CROSS_SERVER_ATTACK` threat. **[Pure Specification]**

### 6.10 Rug-Pull Detection

When `check_rug_pull` is called for a previously registered tool, the
scanner MUST compare the current description hash and schema hash
against the stored fingerprint. If either hash differs, the scanner
MUST return a `RUG_PULL` threat with `CRITICAL` severity and MUST
update the stored fingerprint version. **[Pure Specification]**

### 6.11 MCPSecurityConfig

When no config is provided, the scanner MUST use built-in default
patterns and SHOULD log a warning indicating sample rules are in use.
**[Default Implementation]**

---

## 7. Message Signing

### 7.1 Purpose

MCPMessageSigner provides HMAC-based message signing and replay
protection for MCP messages, ensuring message integrity and
preventing replay attacks across the MCP transport layer.
**[Pure Specification]**

### 7.2 Signing Key Requirements

1. The signing key MUST be at least 32 bytes (256 bits).
2. A `generate_key()` class method MUST produce a
   cryptographically random key of sufficient length.
3. A `from_base64_key()` class method MUST accept a base64-encoded
   key string and decode it.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 7.3 MCPSignedEnvelope

A signed envelope MUST contain:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `payload` | string | Yes | -- | The message payload (JSON string) |
| `nonce` | string | Yes | -- | Unique nonce for replay protection |
| `timestamp` | string | Yes | -- | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp |
| `signature` | string | Yes | -- | HMAC-SHA256 signature (hex-encoded) |
| `sender_id` | string or null | No | null | Optional sender identifier |

**[Pure Specification]**

### 7.4 Signature Computation

The HMAC-SHA256 signature MUST be computed over a canonical string
constructed by concatenating the following fields with a separator:

```
canonical = payload + nonce + timestamp + (sender_id or "")
signature = HMAC-SHA256(signing_key, canonical)
```

The signature MUST be hex-encoded. **[Pure Specification]**

### 7.5 Sign Message

The `sign_message(payload, sender_id=None)` method MUST:

1. Generate a unique nonce (UUID4 or equivalent).
2. Capture the current UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format.
3. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 signature over the canonical string.
4. Return an `MCPSignedEnvelope` containing all fields.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 7.6 MCPVerificationResult

A verification result MUST contain:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `is_valid` | bool | Yes | -- | Whether the message passed verification |
| `payload` | string or null | No | null | The verified payload (only if valid) |
| `sender_id` | string or null | No | null | The verified sender (only if valid) |
| `failure_reason` | string or null | No | null | Reason for verification failure |

Factory methods:
- `success(payload, sender_id)`: Create a valid result.
- `failed(reason)`: Create an invalid result with a failure reason.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 7.7 Verify Message

The `verify_message(envelope)` method MUST perform the following
checks in order:

1. **Timestamp validity:** Parse the envelope timestamp. If parsing
   fails, return `failed("invalid timestamp format")`.
2. **Replay window check:** If the message age exceeds the
   `replay_window`, return `failed("message outside replay window")`.
3. **Nonce uniqueness:** If the nonce has been seen before within the
   replay window, return `failed("duplicate nonce")`.
4. **Signature verification:** Recompute the HMAC-SHA256 signature
   and compare against the envelope signature using constant-time
   comparison. If mismatch, return `failed("invalid signature")`.
5. **Store and success:** Store the nonce in the cache and return
   `success(payload, sender_id)`. If the nonce cannot be stored
   without evicting an in-window nonce (see §7.9), the store fails
   closed and verification MUST return
   `failed("Nonce store at capacity (fail-closed).")` rather than
   accept a message whose nonce cannot be retained for the full
   replay window.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 7.8 Replay Protection Defaults

| Parameter | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replay_window` | 5 minutes | MUST be > 0 |
| `nonce_cache_cleanup_interval` | 10 minutes | MUST be > 0 |
| `max_nonce_cache_size` | 10,000 | MUST be > 0 |

**[Default Implementation]**

### 7.9 Nonce Cache Management

1. The nonce cache MUST be pruned periodically at the configured
   `nonce_cache_cleanup_interval`.
2. Nonces older than the `replay_window` MUST be evicted during
   cleanup.
3. If the cache exceeds `max_nonce_cache_size`, implementations MUST
   reclaim capacity by removing already-expired nonces only. An
   implementation MUST NOT evict a nonce that is still inside its
   `replay_window` to make room, because doing so re-opens the replay
   window for the evicted message. When the cache is full of in-window
   nonces, the implementation MUST fail closed: reject the incoming
   message (see §7.7 step 5) rather than accept a nonce it cannot
   retain. Operators size `max_nonce_cache_size` above the peak
   in-window message volume, or shorten `replay_window`, to avoid
   saturation.
4. A `cleanup_nonce_cache()` method MUST be available for manual
   cache maintenance and MUST return the number of evicted entries.
5. A `cached_nonce_count` property MUST return the current cache
   size.
6. A nonce is considered in-window while `now <= expires_at`
   (retention is inclusive of the exact expiry instant, matching the
   inclusive replay-window check in §7.7 step 2); it is eligible for
   eviction only once `now > expires_at`.

**[Pure Specification]**

A session record MUST contain:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | string | Yes | -- | Cryptographically random session token |
| `agent_id` | string | Yes | -- | Owning agent identifier |
| `user_id` | string or null | No | null | Associated user identifier |
| `created_at` | datetime | Yes | -- | Session creation timestamp (UTC) |
| `expires_at` | datetime | Yes | -- | Session expiry timestamp (UTC) |
| `rate_limit_key` | string | Yes | -- | Key for per-session rate limiting |

An `is_expired` property MUST return `true` if `now(UTC) >= expires_at`.
**[Pure Specification]**

### 8.3 Authenticator Defaults

| Parameter | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session_ttl` | 1 hour | MUST be > 0 |
| `max_concurrent_sessions` | 10 | MUST be > 0 |

**[Default Implementation]**

### 8.4 Session Lifecycle

Implementations MUST provide the following operations:

1. **`create_session(agent_id, user_id=None) -> string`:**
   Generate a cryptographically random token, create a session with
   TTL-based expiry, enforce `max_concurrent_sessions` for the agent
   (evicting oldest sessions if necessary), and return the token.
   **[Pure Specification]**

2. **`bootstrap_session(agent_id, session_token, user_id=None, *, ttl) -> string`:**
   Create a session with a caller-supplied token and custom TTL. This
   is used for test fixtures and migration scenarios.
   **[Pure Specification]**

3. **`validate_session(agent_id, session_token) -> MCPSession | None`:**
   Validate the token belongs to the specified agent and has not
   expired. Return the session if valid, `None` otherwise.
   **[Pure Specification]**

4. **`validate_token(session_token) -> MCPSession | None`:**
   Validate a token without requiring the agent ID. Return the
   session if valid, `None` otherwise.
   **[Pure Specification]**

5. **`revoke_session(session_token) -> bool`:**
   Immediately invalidate a single session. Return `true` if the
   session existed.
   **[Pure Specification]**

6. **`revoke_all_sessions(agent_id) -> int`:**

   Return the number of currently valid (non-expired) sessions.
   **[Pure Specification]**

### 8.5 Session Store Extensibility

Implementations MUST accept an optional external `session_store` for
distributed deployments. When provided, all session CRUD operations
MUST use the external store instead of in-memory storage.
**[Pure Specification]**

### 8.6 Concurrency Enforcement

When an agent creates a new session that would exceed
`max_concurrent_sessions`, the authenticator MUST evict the oldest
session(s) for that agent to make room. **[Pure Specification]**

### 8.7 Expired Session Handling

Expired sessions MUST NOT be returned by `validate_session` or
`validate_token`. Implementations SHOULD perform lazy cleanup of
expired sessions during validation calls. **[Pure Specification]**

---

## 9. Sliding Rate Limiter

### 9.1 Purpose

MCPSlidingRateLimiter enforces per-agent call budgets using a
sliding-window algorithm. Unlike the token bucket used by the
hypervisor rate limiter, the sliding window provides smoother rate
enforcement without burst spikes. **[Pure Specification]**

### 9.2 Algorithm

The sliding-window rate limiter MUST:

1. Maintain a list of timestamps for each agent's recent calls.
2. On each `try_acquire(agent_id)` call, prune timestamps older than
   `window_size` seconds from the current time.
3. If the remaining count is less than `max_calls_per_window`, record
   the current timestamp and return `true`.
4. Otherwise return `false` (rate limited).

**[Pure Specification]**

### 9.3 Defaults

| Parameter | Default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_calls_per_window` | 100 | MUST be > 0 |
| `window_size` | 300 seconds (5 minutes) | MUST be > 0 |

**[Default Implementation]**

### 9.4 Operations

Implementations MUST provide:

- `try_acquire(agent_id) -> bool`: Attempt to consume one call unit.
- `get_remaining_budget(agent_id) -> int`: Return remaining calls in
  the current window.
- `get_call_count(agent_id) -> int`: Return calls made in the current
  window.
- `reset(agent_id) -> None`: Clear an agent's call history.
- `reset_all() -> None`: Clear all agents' call histories.
- `cleanup_expired() -> int`: Remove expired entries for all agents
  and return the count of pruned buckets.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 9.5 Agent ID Normalization

Agent IDs MUST be normalized (e.g., stripped and lowered) to prevent
bypass via casing or whitespace variations. **[Pure Specification]**

### 9.6 Rate Limit Store Extensibility

Implementations MUST accept an optional external `rate_limit_store`
for distributed deployments. When provided, timestamp storage and
retrieval MUST use the external store instead of in-memory state.
**[Pure Specification]**

### 9.7 Thread Safety

All rate limiter operations MUST be thread-safe. Implementations
SHOULD use per-agent locks to minimize contention.
**[Pure Specification]**

---

## 10. Auth Enforcement

### 10.1 Purpose

McpAuthPolicy validates that MCP servers use acceptable
authentication methods and meet TLS requirements. Servers using
`none` authentication are denied by default.
**[Pure Specification]**

**[Default Implementation]**

### 10.6 Check Logic

The `check(server_name, auth_method, url="")` method MUST evaluate:

1. **Method validation:** If `auth_method` is not in
   `VALID_AUTH_METHODS`, DENY with reason indicating unknown method.
2. **Deny-none enforcement:** If `deny_none` is true and
   `auth_method` is `"none"`, DENY.
3. **Per-server check:** If a `McpServerEntry` exists for
   `server_name`, check against that server's `allowed_auth_methods`.
4. **TLS check:** If the server requires TLS and the URL uses
   `http://`, DENY with reason indicating TLS is required.
5. **TLS version check:** If the URL uses TLS, verify the minimum
   TLS version requirement is met.
6. **Default check:** If no per-server entry exists, check against
   `default_allowed_methods`.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 10.7 YAML Configuration

The policy MUST be loadable from YAML via `from_yaml(yaml_content)`.
The YAML schema MUST support:

```yaml
mcp_auth_policy:
  deny_none: true
  default_allowed_methods:

expires, the next `check_package` call MUST re-query the OSV API.
**[Default Implementation]**

### 11.7 Failure Handling

If the OSV API is unreachable or returns an error, the feed MUST
return an empty result set (fail closed -- no false negatives from
cached data, but no false positives from API failures). The error
MUST be logged. **[Pure Specification]**

---

## 17. Configuration

### 17.1 GatewayConfig

Gateway configuration MUST be expressible as a combination of:

1. **Constructor parameters** (Section 3.3) for programmatic
   configuration.
2. **`wrap_mcp_server()`** factory method (Section 3.5) for
   server-specific policy bundling.

**[Pure Specification]**

### 17.2 MCPSecurityConfig YAML Loading

The `load_mcp_security_config(path)` function MUST:

1. Read the YAML file at the given path using `yaml.safe_load()`.
2. Extract pattern lists from the YAML document.
3. Compile regex patterns and return an `MCPSecurityConfig` instance.
4. If the file cannot be read or parsed, raise an appropriate error.

YAML parsing MUST use `yaml.safe_load()`, never `yaml.load()`.
**[Pure Specification]**

| MCPGateway | `intercept_tool_response` | Block the response |
| MCPSecurityScanner | `scan_tool` | Treat as unsafe (return threats) |
| MCPSecurityScanner | `check_rug_pull` | Treat as potential rug pull |
| MCPMessageSigner | `verify_message` | Return `failed(reason)` |
| MCPSessionAuthenticator | `validate_session` | Return `None` (invalid) |
| MCPSessionAuthenticator | `validate_token` | Return `None` (invalid) |

verification) MUST have configurable timeouts. When a timeout occurs,
the operation MUST fail closed per Section 18.1.
**[Pure Specification]**

## 19. Security Considerations

### 19.1 Tool Poisoning Defense

The MCPSecurityScanner provides defense against tool poisoning by
scanning descriptions for hidden instructions, encoded payloads,
invisible Unicode, and prompt injection patterns. All tools MUST be
scanned before being made available to agents. The scanner MUST
detect at least the six threat types defined in Section 6.2.

### 19.2 Rug-Pull Defense

Tool fingerprinting (Section 6.5) enables detection of silent tool
modifications. Operators SHOULD register tool fingerprints during
initial deployment and MUST check for rug pulls on every tool
re-registration or periodic scan. Any fingerprint change MUST
produce a CRITICAL alert.

### 19.3 Replay Attack Prevention

HMAC-based message signing (Section 7) with nonce caching and
replay window enforcement prevents message replay attacks. The 5-
minute default replay window balances security against clock skew
tolerance. Implementations MUST use constant-time comparison for
signature verification to prevent timing side-channel attacks.

### 19.4 Session Hijacking Prevention

Session tokens MUST be generated using cryptographically secure
random number generators. Session TTLs (default 1 hour) limit the
window of exposure for stolen tokens. The `revoke_session` operation
provides immediate invalidation.

### 19.5 Rate Limit Bypass Prevention

Agent ID normalization (Section 9.5) prevents bypass via casing or
whitespace. The sliding window algorithm prevents burst-based bypass
that fixed-window algorithms allow.

### 19.6 TLS Enforcement

Auth enforcement (Section 10) defaults to requiring TLS 1.2 or
higher. Servers using `http://` URLs with `require_tls=true` MUST be
rejected. The `none` authentication method is denied by default.

### 19.7 Response Injection Prevention

Response scanning (Section 5) prevents MCP servers from injecting
malicious instructions into tool responses. This defends against
scenarios where a compromised MCP server returns prompt injection
payloads, credential-harvesting content, or exfiltration URLs
disguised as tool output.

### 19.8 Cross-Server Attack Prevention

The security scanner's cross-server and typosquatting checks
(Section 6.9) defend against attacks where a malicious MCP server
registers tools with names similar to legitimate tools on other
servers, attempting to intercept tool calls.

### 19.9 Description Injection Prevention

Tool descriptions are sanitized on registration (Section 14.7) by
stripping control characters and enforcing length limits. This
prevents tools from embedding prompt injection payloads in their
descriptions that would be included in agent prompts.

### 19.10 Argument Size Limits

Serialized argument size limits (1 MB default, Section 14.6) prevent
memory-based denial-of-service attacks through oversized tool call
payloads.

### 19.11 Internal Network Protection

The TrustGatedMCPClient blocks connections to internal and loopback
addresses (Section 14.9), preventing SSRF attacks where an agent
could be tricked into connecting to internal services.
